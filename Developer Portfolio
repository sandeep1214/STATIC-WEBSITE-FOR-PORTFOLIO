        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>My name is <strong>Sandeep</strong>, and I am currently pursuing my <strong>MSc in Data Science</strong> at the <strong>University of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom</strong>. My Master's program equips me with advanced skills in machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analytics, and statistical modelling.</p>

        <p>I previously completed my <strong>B.Tech in Information Technology</strong> from <strong>Marri Laxman Reddy Institute of Technology and Management</strong>, where I developed a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and software development.</p>

        <p>During my academic journey, I completed internships at <strong>InternPe</strong> and <strong>CodeClause</strong>, allowing me to gain hands-on experience in real-world problem-solving and collaborative development.</p>

        <p>I have worked on impactful academic projects such as <strong>Hand-Controlled Virtual Mouse</strong> and <strong>Driver Behaviour Recognition Using CNN</strong>, which enhanced my expertise in computer vision, deep learning, and user-interaction systems.</p>

        <p>I am passionate about technology, data science, AI-driven solutions, and creative problem-solving. I enjoy taking on challenging tasks that allow me to learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully to innovative organizations.</p>
        
        <p>Outside academics, I enjoy reading, coding, playing cricket, and listening to music. I consider myself a self-motivated individual with strong communication skills and a continuous learning mindset.</p>

        <p>My short-term goal is to secure a role in a reputed company, and my long-term goal is to grow into a position where I can make a meaningful impact while helping the organisation grow as well.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>Driver Behaviour Recognition using Lightweight CNN</h3>
        <p>This project proposes a CNN-based solution to recognize driver behavior using a lightweight neural network combined with attention mechanisms. The system is designed to be non-invasive, cost-effective, and efficient in identifying risky or distracted driving patterns.</p>

        <h3>Hand-Controlled Virtual Mouse</h3>
        <p>An AI-based human-computer interaction system that enables users to control the mouse cursor using hand gestures. This project leverages computer vision techniques to provide touch-free, gesture-based navigation.</p>
